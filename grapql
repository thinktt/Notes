//Story of GraphQL Request
Read input from interface
Parse into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
Resolver function for every node in the tree nodes is invoked
  returns scaler value or 
  object who's types have resolver functions
Child Node Reolver Functions invoked
Data servers will ask partial questions about the data
Data returned is merged into single object
Server sends response


graphQL queries have two types of fields
Scaler fields - primative types
Complex Fields
Both fields are modeled after functions, and map to resolver functions
GraphQLID is a primative type used often used to refetch and 
  object data, appears in responses as a string
Fields that represent objects usually have a custon type
