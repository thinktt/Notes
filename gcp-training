Regions - colletcion of zones
Zone 
  Isolated deployment areas in a region
  A unit of compute power, high bandwidth
  you can spread your resources across multiple zones
Regions are in a certain space
  you may pick a region for, regulation, speed
Points of Precence?

Projects 
  Abstraction that owns eveyrthing you do on GCP
  Security boundry
  Network you are working with
  Billing
  Uniquely named
  Project id a-name-like-this
  ID number (mostly not used by you)

Identity and Access Manament (IAM)
  Who - can do what - on what resources
  Primative Roles - Owner, Editer, Viewer
    Owner can do anything
  Now you can define "curate roles"
    Google Groups, scopes
      compute.instance.delete
      compute.instces.get
      compute.instaces.list
      compute.instacne.start
      compute.instaces.stop
  Deny everything first and selectively allow

App Engine and Cloud Datastore
  Opinionated Architecture

IaaS Raw 
  compute, storage, and network
  granual control

App Engine (PaaS) 
  Java, Go, PHP, Python
  Standard enviroment
    specific versions 
    no writing to local file systems
    request timeouts at 60 seonds
    limit on 3rd party software installation
    task queues
    memcache 
      shared memory between the instances
      one network hop away
  App Engine flexible Enviroment
    can do node
    can take minutes to load
    scaling, manual, automatic
    can run Node
    ssh access
    uses containers in the background
  Google Cloud Endpoints
  Google Cloud Datastore
    build a database system that can respond as fast as possible
    only suports access through indexes
    everything you put in has an index
    two indexes for everything, front and back
    great for reading things quickly
    write speed is slow, every write every index musst be updated
    scalable noSQL DB
    you should care about schemas though and how system works
    acid transactions??

Cloud Storage
  bukets, binary large objects, just storage
  simple administration
  redundant
  immuatable?
  data encrtion in fling and at rest
  data coming in is free data out cost you 
  four storage classes give customers flexibility
    Mutil-regional, Regional
    Nearline, Coldline 
      medium and long term archiving
    Coldline
    All the same for durability
  Extremely durable storage
  Regional bukets
  Objct versioning
  Offline iports (third party)
  ACLs (Access Control List)
  Imutable, can't change an object
  bukcets must be uniquely named
  google requires you to verify domain name buckets
  gsutil rsync . gs://bucket-name
  can map static content to a bucket
Cloud Bigtable
  a really really big table of data
  scales insaney high
  sustains 10 thousand queries per second
  fully managed NoSQL wided-column
  datbase service for large workload
  replicated storage
  data encryption in flight and at rest
  role based ACL
  data an be read from and written to cloud Bitable 
  can stand up to batch processing
Dataproc
On-premise

CloudSQL
  Offers MySQL and PostgreSQL(Beta)
  Automatic replcation
  Managed backups
  Vertial scaling (red and write)?
  Horizontal scaling (read)?

Spanner
  Distributed relational database is super hard
  Acid transactions?
  Global, relational, transactional database

DB Use Cases
  Spanner
  Cloud Data Store
    Read read read
  Cloud storage 
    store anything

Container engine
  container lightwheight context that runs on linux kernel
  containers come to life in miliseconds
  a container can have one app running only has dependencies it needs
  isolation and speed of deployment
  why use them containers
    consitency, development, testing, production
    loose coupling between app aon os layer
    much sipler to migrate workloads between on prmeinse and cloud env
    support agile dev and operations
  Kubernetes 
    Open Source conainer cluster orchestration system
    based on Google's experience over 10+ years
    built for multi-cloud world
    public, private, hybrid
    workload portablility
    rolling updates
    persistent storage
    multi-zone clustesr
    load balancing
    autoscaling
  Container Engine is Googles Kubernetes offering
  Is not a PaaS it's inbetween an IaaS and a PaaS
  a system for running containers as Google has found works
  works on top of compute engine
  decouling operations and dev cocerns
  Container Builder
    Create Docker catainers images form app code in Cloud Storage
    Google Container Registry
      secure, priveate, docker image storage
  Can federate clustsers in multiple places/clouds
  Clusters in Kubernetes is evolving to use mixed locations

Compute Egine
  Hight CPU, high memoery, standard and shared-core machines types
  Local SSD
    no network latency, can do fast preformance but no snapshot type features
  Snapshots, only snapshots what you have, does diffs for next snapshot
    gcloud compute disk snapshot snapshot-name
  Google has it's own internal DNS so you can just ask for your named server
  metadata for project and for instances

Networking
  Software defined networking
  Subnetting becoes boundaries for resources
  tag servers and rules will apply by tag
Cloud DNS
Cloud Inerconnect
Cloud Virtual Networks
  deafault network let's things connect
Fine-grained networking policies
granular IP address range selection
Routes
Firewalls

Load Balancing
  Balance based traffic acrosos multiple compute engine regions
  Global, eteranl Ip address routes traffic
  Scalabl, requires no prewarming and privdes resiiliaece,
    and fault tolerance
Cloud CDN 
  Use Googles globally distributed edge caches to chache HTTP

Stackdriver 
  Integrated monitoring and logging diagnostics
  Monitoring, logging, debugging, so on

Deployment Manager
  Infastructure managent service
  Create a .yaml template describing your env
  provides repeatable deployments

Cloud Functions
  
BigQuery
  Analytis 
    daabase, stream data at 100,000 rows per second
    exact opposite of data store
    BQ has no indices, always scans all the data in paralell
    column based storage
    fully managed no ops service
    storage cost measured by one GB per month
    BQ is a good place to wharehouse your data
    useses SQL 2011 now
    you can ask questions that you couldn't ask before
    they don't charge for compute resources, storage of data
    and number of bytes to scan for query
    store things corectly and you can just search what you want and 
      save money

Pub/Sub
  Supports many-to-many saychronous messaging
  push pull supbscritions to topics
  guarnateed at least once delivery
  buffered, massivly scalable

Dataflow
  Process data using compute engine instances
  clusters are sized for you
  Autmated scalin , no instace provisioning required
  Google figures out what you need for what you're trying to do
  Write code onc and get batch and streaming
  ETL(extract/trafor/load)

Dataproc: managed Hadoop
  Fast easy managed way to run Haddop and Saprk/Hive/Pig on GCP
  cerate clusters in 90 sec or less
  scale clusers up and down even when jobs are running
  can use preimtable instances for the cluster

Datalab
  Interactive tool for large scale data exploration, transormation, analysis, visualization
