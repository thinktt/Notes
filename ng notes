Angular Elements
Directives
Angular Expressions
Controllers
Services
Filters
Views - NO! It's just HTML 
$scope
$http
$rescource


.........................
Invoking Angular
1. Load js
2. use ng-app directive (tell angular what part of DOM to use)

Model View Controller - All Agular apps have: 
* A model containing data, representing current state of app
* Views that display this data
* Controllers that manage the relationship between model and views

ng-change(callback) (when field changes call callback)
ng-submit (a form attr, set equal to callback, default post will be stopped )
ng-click (attr, set equal to a callback for click event)

ng-repeat = "thing in things" (make elements by iterating trhough an object) 
$first, $middle, $last, $repeat (some usable variables during the iteration)


$scope.$watch(thingToWatch, callback) (watch for var change then run callback)

ng-src (use instead of src on <img> tags )
ng-href (used instead of href for <a> tags)


............................................
Angular Expressions

simpel math  (+, -, /, *, %), 
make comparisons (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=), 
perform boolean logic (&&, ||, !) 
and bitwise operations (\^, &, |). 
functions you expose on $scope in your controller and you can 
reference arrays and object notation ([ ], { }, .)
null evaluated expressions will simply do nothing 


........................
Conroller Responsibilities
1. Set up intitial state in your app
2. Expose model and fuctions to view (UI template) through $scope
3. Watch other parts of the model and take action

Good Practice: Create one controller per functional area i your view

Two Ways to Associate a Controller
1. Specify in View/Template using ng-controller
2. Associating it with dynamically loaded DOM template fragment 
	(done through routes and views)

Nested Controllers
<div ng-controller="ParentController">
  <div ng-controller="ChildController">...</div>
</div>
Child controller will have access to parents $scope

..............................
Model
Indirect ways to set up model from the template
1. expressions, setting prperties directly in scope of the element
2. using ng-model in form field, creates bi-directional data binding

$watch(watchFn, watchAction, deepWatch)
watchFn (string or with angular expression or function that returns watch value
  		also can take a $scope function)
watchAtion (function called whne watch watchFn ghanges)
deepWatch (bool used when need to watch a whole array or object)

$watch returns function that will de-register the watch when run:
deReg = $watch(); 
deReg() (kills the watch)
$watch with only watchFn passed will evaluate 
	evertime angular evaluates  the page


...................
Module Object

provider(name, Object OR constructor())
	if passed an object include $get in it, that returns instance of object
	otherwise Angular assumes you are passing a constructor
factory(name, $getFunction()) 
	(non configurable service with complex creation logic)
service(name, contsructor)
	(non-configurable service with simple creation logic)

defining: 
var appMod = angular.module('app', ['SnazzyUIWidgets', 'SuperDataSync']);

................
Filters
{{ expression | filterName : parameter1 : ...parameterN }}
creating your own
module.filter('name', filterFn(input){})

Routes
var module = angular.module('someModule', ['ngRoute']); 

someModule.config(function($routeProvider) {
  $routeProvider.
    .when('url', {controller:aController, templateUrl:'/path/to/template'})
    .when(...other mappings for your app...)
    â€¦
    .otherwise(...what to do if nothing else matches...);
)};

ng-view (used in the teplate to show where the view goes)

Talking to Servers
function ShoppingController($scope, $http) {
  $http.get('/products').success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
    $scope.items = data;
  });
}























Services are single instance object used to carry out task 
	necesarry to support application functioning
	may be passed between controllers.
