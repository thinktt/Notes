Design Security Concepts
  Least Priviledge - Only give what is needed for the task
  Spearation of Duties - No one should be able to do everything
  Defense in Depth - No single point of compromise
  Fail Secure - On failure, Confidentiality, Availability, and Integrity remains
  Economy of Mechanism - Complexity in design increases chance of security failure
  Complete Mediation - Every access request should be checked for authority to do access
  Open Design - No security by obscurity, security open for review
  Least Common Mechanism - shared mechanims between users or processes must be minimized
  Phycological Acceptability - If it doesn't make sense to the user they will try to find a way around it
  Levraging Existing Components - Use existing functionality to limit attack surface
  Weakest Link - security is only as good as the the weakest link in software
  Single Point of Failure - do not have a single source of weakness that in complete compromise

Privacy
  Don't collect sensitive info unless reqired
  Only keep what you must store, don't keep it longer than you have to
  Reference local privacy laws
Data Anonymization - Make it not personalized
Disposal Stage - make sure you destroy it when you don't need it anymore
Data Dispostion
  Regulation - How organization handles PII, PHI, PFI, or Disposal of data
  Disposal - Destroy the, only valid if info is non-sensitve, make data useless
  Purging - rendering media unrecoverable 
  Destroying - make data damaged to point of nearly impossible to revoer
    Disintigration, Pulverazation, Melting 

Governance, Risk and Compliance
  Regulation
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act(SOX)
      Design of internal controls for Financial and IT systems
      Put in place after Enron
    Basel II 
      Internation Standard for Bankging Regulation out Europe
      Proceeded by Basel III
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act(GLBA)
      Provisions to protect personal financial inormation by fananical instituions
      About how you must protect personal financial information
      International Regulation 
    Health Insurance Protability and Accountability Act HIPPA
      Privacy of health data, standard of trafsfer of this data
      Like GLBA for Health Data
      US only Regulation 
    Data Protection Act 
      Deals with protection of personally indentifable data
      Requires consent for collection of pesonal identifalbe data
      Region specific 
    Computer Misuse Act
      Early act defines kacing, unaothorized access and modification as an offense
  Standards
    Internal Standards (Best Practices or Guildines)
     Coding Standards, can include libraries
    External Standards
      Insdustry standards and goverment standards 
       PCI (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
        Certain elements of credit card can not be stored
    NIST - US standards 
    ISO
      Common Criteria, way to evaluate security 
  
Risk Managment  
  Identify the risk profile of an application
  Software Development Life Cycle
    Plan, Dev, Prod, consider risk at each stage
  Vulnerabliity, Asset, Threat
  Attack, Likelyhood and Impact
  Buisness vs Technical Risk 
  Ways to manage Risk
    Mitigate - impliment a control to manage the risk 
    Tranfer - tranfer the risk to a 3rd party (use their credit card payment service)
    Avoid - remove the risk, don't use the risky thing, take down the app ect 
    Accept - to accept risk buisness owner MUST sign off on it and understand it

Methodologies
  Spiral every phase has a risk assesment at each phase
    not prevalent
  Iterative - break it up into small prototypes
    Every part is done as if it's own project
  Waterfall - predefined sequential phases
    tratitional, requirmentts design, development, testing, deployment
  Agile - most poplular
    Test driven development 
    based on iteration 
    Full loop every interation
  Security Methodologies
    Socratic - question answer 
    STRIDE
      Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Discolsure, Denial of service, Elevation of Privilage
    DREAD 
      Discoverability, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Damage Potential
    Flaw Hypothesi Method - Uses Pen Testing in phases
      1 Hypthesize flaws in the system for documentation
      2 Confirm flaws through pen-testing
      3 Generalize confirmed flaws to uncover security issues
      4 Add counter measures to new versions of sftware
      Only known threats can be identified
    Six Sigma - focusses on removing defects
      defects are deviation from the requirements
    Capability Maturity Model Intigration 
      A rating scale that can be used to measer maturity of software 
      1 Processa are adhoc, reative and unpredicatble
      2 Repeatable project managment schedue and cost
      3 Established processses, proactive and improve continuously
      4 Processes are measured for improvement uing metrics
      5 Continous process improvement and optimizaiton 
    OSSTMM Open Security Testing Methodlogoy Manual
      A methodology for preforming security test
      Focusses on data and mesurements
      5 test channels
        Security Awareness
        Social Engineering
        Networks
        Wireless and mobile devices
        Physical access
        Security processes
        Building security
    OCTAVE  Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerbilty Evaluation
      Risk based security assesment methology
      3 Stages
        1 Build asset based threat profile
        2 Identify vulnerabilities
        3 Develop security strategy and plans
